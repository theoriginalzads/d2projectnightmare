### A GZDoom Compatible PWAD for Doom II
Welcome to the GitHub page of Doom II: Project Nightmare. I'll be updating this thing soon with some more information as soon as I get a moment. For the time being, check out the [releases](https://github.com/theoriginalzads/d2projectnightmare/releases) section for the latest assembled release of the PWAD, which is actually a ZIP file, and works in GZDoom.

Pro tip: If you download the entire project structure off GitHub and compress it into a ZIP file, if done right, it should load in to GZDoom without a problem. Handy if you just want to grab the latest version and I've not put up a release yet.
### What's the Story?
This is coming soon.
### What Do I Need to Play?
To run this PWAD, you'll need a legitimate copy of a Doom II IWAD, which is something you can still purchase through sources like Steam.

You'll also need the latest version of the GZDoom source port. This IWAD isn't tested or likely compatible with any other source ports as it does rely heavily on GZDoom features, including ACS. You can get a copy of GZDoom from [here](https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom).

Lastly, you'll need to get a copy of [Back to Saturn X Episode 1](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/btsx_e1) and bring along the 2nd WAD file in that pack. My WAD uses the textures from BTSX Ep 1, but I'm not going to include them within my pack as they are owned by the creators of that pack. Full credit to their team for the awesome textures used in that WAD and I highly recommend you play through their WADs if you haven't done so already.

I will make a list of music you can add to my WAD to give it the ambience that I intended, however since the music is copyrighted and those creators deserve the royalties from the purchases of that music, I won't be including them within the pack. I'll list the songs, links to where you can get them and a how-to on adding them to my map pack to get them working shortly. (To do item!).
### Credits
The maps themselves are so far created by myself, with some taking inspiration from other maps. MAP02 Red Key Blue Key takes some designs from the original Doom II by ID Software and were included for a familiarity and nostalgic trip for players.

The replacement Doom Guy faces are from [The Freedoom Project](https://freedoom.github.io/about.html) and is credited to them. It is used under the BSD License and included in this project.

Sprites from Doom II that have had pallet adjustments made are included in this project and are included for compatibility reasons. These sprites are still property of ID Software.

There are some included textures in this project that are derived and customised from Back to Saturn X textures. Majority of textures used in the maps are not included within this project (except for the ones that have been heavily customised or newly created) and come from the use of the BTSX Ep 1 WAD.
### Giving Feedback
If you want to give feedback, report any issues, bugs, or even be a playtester, any feedback is appreciated. Please go to the feedback form at the bottom of [this page](https://procrasturbate.net/about-me/) to shoot me an e-mail.
### Status of Maps
Below is the status of the maps included in this pack.
|Map|Status|
|--|--|
|MAP01 - Point Insanity|95% Complete. Playable and finalised with some minor texture issues remaining, and might need some balancing adjustments. Layout is final. Might add a secret exit relating to the reactor blowing up.|
|MAP02 - Red Key Blue Key|Initial area is mostly finalised up until one of the keys (red or blue skull) is collected. No Exit. Not happy with the area north of the key locations and will likely be redesigned from scratch.|
|MAP03 - The Office is Doomed!|Progression from start to unlocking the teleporter room is mostly complete. Enemy placement, security office, some scripting in the initial parts still required. Trash Processing trap needs some attention. No Exit.|

07/12/2022 - My current focus is on finishing MAP01. Though I'm getting quite the drive to make progress on MAP03 at the moment as I'm a bit stuck on how to progress MAP02 at the moment. I like the concept for MAP02 but I don't really know how I'd like each pathway to progress right now.
