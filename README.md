# Working Title: Doom II: Project Nightmare
## A GZDoom Compatible PWAD for Doom II
Welcome to the GitHub page of Doom II: Project Nightmare. I'll be updating this thing soon with some more information as soon as I get a moment. For the time being, check out the 'releases' section for the latest assembled release of the PWAD, which is actually a ZIP file, and works in GZDoom.

## What Do I Need?
To run this PWAD, you'll need the latest version of GZDoom as well as a Doom II IWAD.
You will also need a copy of Back To Saturn X Episode 1's B PWAD file.
There's also some music I'd recommend to go with this that you'll need to add to the ZIP file yourself, since it is copywrited. I'll add links to it shortly.
